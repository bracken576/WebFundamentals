        <h2>Bracken Sant</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Bracken Sant. I am a Computer Science major for now but I plan on changing it to Data Science.
             I love to program, go to the gym, and play baseball (I'm in a softball league right now). Web design is at
             least important to know in Computer Science and in Data Science, because you may need to work with someone who
             is designing the company website and be able to work with and understand what they are talking about. I was born a
             member of the chruch and my favorite quote from a leader of the church is by Cecil O. Samuelson, "Worthiness and
             perfection don't mean the same thing!"</p>
