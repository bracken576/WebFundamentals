        Hello, I'm Bracken Sant and I am a Sophomore at BYU-Idaho studying Data Science. Within the Data Science major, I am pursuing statistical analysis of data through programming with R and various libraries in Python, including, Pandas and Altair. I have been programming since high school in Java, Python, and C#, and have become proficient with the data structures within computer science, hierarchical structures, and working with APIs. Throughout my 6 years of programming, I have developed a love for problem solving, programming, and sifting through data. I have also developed a love for working hard on a project and have become addicted to the feeling of satisfaction after finishing a big project.

      <h3>Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        I have only recently switched over to the Data Science major and have a computer science background. I have taken two classes with data science programming and I have taken two classes for statistics. Two of the classes were in R, one in Python, and one with excel. One of my classes was Data Wrangling and Visualization: with this class I learned how to manipulate or sort and organize data and how to make appopriate graphs for the data given. For my statistics classes I learned about different statistical tests: t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, chi-squared, along with non-parametric tests like Kruskal-Wallis. In my data science programming class I manipulated data with a Python library called Pandas and made graphs with Altair.

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>
        I have over 6 years of experience with programming. I first started in Highschool with Java and Python and learned C# as well. In college I have studied Parallelism and Concurrency in programming in Python. I have also studied data structures, programming with classes, and hierarchy and inheritance in programming. Some other languages that I have worked with are Javascript, Clojure, HTML, and Erlang. The languages that I am most proficient in are Python and C#.
