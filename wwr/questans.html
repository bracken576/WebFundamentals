                <p class="answers">
                    For safety reasons children 8 and older are recommended. However, it is also recommended that they can swim and are reasonably mature, since this can be a dangerous activity. People over 70 should consult with their doctor or be reasonably confident in their physical health in order to participate in this activity for the same reason as before. There are varying levels of difficulty, this allows for most age groups to be able to participate and enjoy their time without being in too much risk of danger.

                <h3 class="questions">Is it really worth the price?</h3>
                <p class="answers">
                    There are some that may say it is not. However, we would be lying to you if we said it wasn't. There are beautiful sights among the rivers that we cover and it is a thrilling experience you can't get anywhere else. It also covers multiple nights, with tents and food provided. You get away from the city and out in the wilderness, where you don't have to worry about work or school. So, if you seek adventure and are looking for beautiful sights while you get away from your normal life it is definetly worth the price.
